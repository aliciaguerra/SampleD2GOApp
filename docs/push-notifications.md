## Push Notifications ##

First of all, you need a Firebase Project at [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Once in there, go to **Settings > Cloud Messaging** and copy the _Server Key_ (you need to provide this key in the Digital2Go platform in order to generate push notifications).

Digital2Go SDK uses FirebaseCloud Messaging (FCM) to receive push notifications, in order to receive and handle, please follow FCM Documentation [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/android/client?hl=es-419)
