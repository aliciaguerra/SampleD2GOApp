## Interacting with Digital2Go Platform.

The Digital2Go Android Client interacts with beacons and geofences to display contain created in the Digital2Go Cloud Platform.

When a beacon or geofence is detected, it ask the Digital2Go back-end for a related campaign to show it up.

To interact with the Digital2Go Cloud Platform, the user needs to provide the **app username** and **app password** so the app can search for local offers triggered by beacons and geofences.

Here we explain how to setup all this tasks in your app.
